 /****
    The method getStartDay() implements Zeller's Algorithm for determining the
    day of the week the first day of a month is. The method adjusts Zeller's
    numbering scheme for day of week ( 0=Saturday, ..., 6=Friday ) to conform
    to a day of week number that corresponds to ISO conventions (i.e.,
    1=Monday, ..., 7=Sunday)
  
  Pre-Conditions: The month value, m,  is 1-12
                  The year value, y, is the full year (e.g., 2012)
                  
  Post-Conditions: A value of 1-7 is returned, representing the first day of
  the month: 1 = Monday, ..., 7 = Sunday
